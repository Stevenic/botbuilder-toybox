/**
 * This middleware patches an issue where for some channels, including the emulator, the initial 
 * `from` field for a `conversationUpdate` activity is either missing or not correct. The issue is
 * this ends up causing state management plugins to load/save state for the wrong (or no) user from 
 * the bots perspective and can cause you to pull your hair out when debugging. Unfortunately, this
 * issue apparently isn't an easy issue for the channels to fix as they don't often know who the 
 * correct user is. Especially, in group conversations.
 * 
 * This plugin does it's best to patch the issue by ensuring that the `from` account for non-message
 * activities is never the bot or some system account. In 1-on-1 conversations this should result in 
 * a solid fix and in group conversations it sort of depends whether all the conversation members get 
 * added at once or not. If members are added individually things will be fine but if multiple members 
 * get added to the conversation at the same time we leave the `from` field alone unless its missing.
 * Then we just assign the first member from the group as the sender. 
 * 
 * To use the plugin add it to your middleware stack before any state management middleware:
 * 
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { FromPatch } = require('botbuilder-toybox-middleware');
 *
 * bot.use(new FromPatch());
 * ```
