 * Deploying new versions of your bot more often then not should have little
 * to no impact on the current conversations you're having with a user. Sometimes, however, a change
 * to your bots conversation logic can result in the user getting into a stuck state that can only be
 * fixed by their conversation state being deleted.
 *
 * This middleware lets you track a version number for the conversations your bot is having so that
 * you can automatically delete the conversation state anytime a major version number difference is
 * detected. Example:
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { CheckVersion } = require('botbuilder-toybox-extensions');
 * const { ConversationScope } = require('botbuilder-toybox-memories');
 *
 * // Initialize memory fragment to hold our version number.
 * const convoScope = new ConversationScope(new MemoryStorage());
 * const convoVersion = convoScope.fragment('convoVersion');
 *
 * // Add middleware to check the version and clear the scope on change.
 * adapter.use(new CheckVersion(convoVersion, 2.0, async (context, version, next) => {
 *     await convoScope.forgetAll(context);
 *     await context.sendActivity(`I'm sorry. My service has been upgraded and we need to start over.`);
 *     await next();
 * }));
 * ```
