 *
 * This middleware lets you automatically send a 'typing' activity if your bot is taking
 * too long to reply to a message. Most channels require you periodically send an additional
 * 'typing' activity in order to keep the typing indicator lite so the middleware plugin will
 * automatically send additional messages at a given rate until it sees the bot send a reply.
 *
 * **Usage Example**
 *
 * ```JavaScript
 * const { ShowTyping } = require('botbuilder-toybox-extensions');
 *
 * adapter.use(new ShowTyping());
 * ```
 *
 * > It should be noted that the plugin sends 'typing' activities directly through the bots
 * > adapter so these additional activities will not go through middleware or be logged.
