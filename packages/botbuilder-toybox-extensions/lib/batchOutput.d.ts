/**
 * :package: **botbuilder-core-extensions**
 *
 * A fluent style mechanism for composing a batch of outgoing activities.  You can use this class
 * on its own anywhere within your bot and you will just need to ensure that you call [flush()](#flush)
 * before the turn completes:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  return new BatchOutput(context)
 *      .typing()
 *      .delay(1000)
 *      .reply(`Hi... What's your name?`)
 *      .flush();
 * ```
 *
 * The other option is to use this class as a piece of middleware. This will add a new
 * `context.batch` property which you can use to call any of the methods below. It will also
 * automatically flush all queued responses upon completion of the turn, eliminating the need to
 * explicitly call flush:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  adapter.use(new BatchOutput());
 *
 *  adapter.processRequest(req, res, (context) => {
 *      context.batch.reply(`Hello World`);
 *  });
 * ```
 *
 * For TypeScript users you can use a custom interface that extends the `TurnContext` interface to
 * get full intellisense for the added property:
 *
 * ```javascript
 *  interface MyContext extends TurnContext {
 *      readonly batch: BatchOutput;
 *  }
 *
 *  adapter.use(new BatchOutput());
 *
 *  adapter.processRequest(req, res, (context: MyContext) => {
 *      context.batch.reply(`Hello World`);
 *  });
 * ```
 *
 * The class supports mixed modes of usage so it's fine to both use it as middleware and then
 * create a new instance of the class somewhere else within your bots logic or within other
 * middleware.

     * of the message to the user.  If a bot sends a message with only text immediately after
     * sending a message with images, the messages could end up being shown to the user out of

     * When used in conjunction with the `ConversationState` middleware, sending an `endOfConversation`
     * activity will cause the bots conversation state to be automatically cleared. If you're
     * building a Cortana skill this helps ensure that the next time your skill is invoked it
     * will be in a clean state given that you won't always get a new conversation ID in between
     * invocations.
     *
     * Even for non-Cortana bots it's a good practice to send an `endOfConversation` anytime you
     * complete a task with the user as it will give your bot a chance to clear its conversation
     * state and helps avoid your bot getting into a bad state for a conversation.
