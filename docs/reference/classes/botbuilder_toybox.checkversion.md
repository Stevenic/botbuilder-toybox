# Class: CheckVersion


:package: **botbuilder-toybox-extensions**

Deploying new versions of your bot more often then not should have little to no impact on the current conversations you're having with a user. Sometimes, however, a change to your bots conversation logic can result in the user getting into a stuck state that can only be fixed by their conversation state being deleted.

This middleware lets you track a version number for the conversations your bot is having so that you can automatically delete the conversation state anytime a major version number difference is detected. Example:

**Usage Example**

    const { CheckVersion } = require('botbuilder-toybox-extensions');
    const { ConversationScope } = require('botbuilder-toybox-memories');

    // Initialize memory fragment to hold our version number.
    const convoScope = new ConversationScope(new MemoryStorage());
    const convoVersion = convoScope.fragment('convoVersion');

    // Add middleware to check the version and clear the scope on change.
    adapter.use(new CheckVersion(convoVersion, 2.0, async (context, version, next) => {
        await convoScope.forgetAll(context);
        await context.sendActivity(`I'm sorry. My service has been upgraded and we need to start over.`);
        await next();
    }));
