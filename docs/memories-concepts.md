## Scopes and Fragments
Memories breaks the botsâ€™ memory up into scopes and each scope contains 1 or more fragments. Scopes have a lifetime that can vary on a per request basis. The [UserScope](./reference/classes/botbuilder_toybox.userscope.md) for instance remembers things about a user across of their interactions with the bot. The [ConversationScope](./reference/classes/botbuilder_toybox.conversationscope.md), by contrast, only remembers things for a single session. Fragments let you define strongly typed properties within a given scope.
